# Flight_Delay_Dashboard
In this assignment, I developed a data visualization application using the Python programming language. I utilized libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Dash. Firstly, I created a web application using the Dash library, allowing users to select a specific year. Upon selecting a year, calculations were performed on the flight data, and interactive line charts displaying the average delay times were generated based on these calculations.

Key sections of the code include:

Loading flight data into a DataFrame using the Pandas library.
Creating a user interface with Dash to capture the user's input for the year.
Processing data based on the user's selected year through a callback function and generating line charts using the Plotly library.
Displaying the generated charts in a web browser.
This assignment enabled me to enhance my Python programming skills and further develop my abilities in creating interactive web applications for data analysis.
